  Hello, my name is Joanna Hong, a Ph.D. candidate in Electrical Engineering at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology. 
  I am researching in Image and Video Systems Lab., under the supervision of Professor Yong Man Ro. 
 
  My major research area is multi-modal representation learning and human interactive learning. 
  I am more focusing on integrating audio, video, and text modalities in human dialogue system, especially lipreading, lip-to-speech synthesis, and audio-visual speech recognition. 
  I am also interested in machine translation, speech enhancement, and speech separation using multi-modal representations.

          I will be joining Audio Machine Learning and Computer Vision research team in Meta Reality Labs under Anurag Kumar. 
          The team focus on audio signal processing, machine learning and audio visual learning to solve important audio-driven problems for AR/VR applications.
          I am expected to have projects regarding multimodal representation learning, audio visual scene analysis, egocentric audio visual learning, multi-sensory speech enhancement and acoustic activity localization.
