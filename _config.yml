# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.
#
# If you need help with YAML syntax, here are some quick references for you:

#
# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  I'm a Fourth-year PhD Student in CASIA working in multi-agent reinforcement learning. I graduated from Beijing Jiaotong University in July 2019.

  I am interested in probabilistic graphical model, generative model, contrastive learning and multi-agent reinforcement learning. Recently I worked on MARL applied on video game and route packeging. I also serve as a reviewer on International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML) and Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS).
