  Hello, I'm a Fourth-year PhD Student in CASIA working in multi-agent reinforcement learning. I graduated from Beijing Jiaotong University in July 2019.

  I am interested in probabilistic graphical model, generative model, contrastive learning and multi-agent reinforcement learning. Recently I worked on MARL applied on video game and route packeging. I also serve as a reviewer on International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML) and Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS).
